      <title>Jedi: Fallen Order</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not ashamed to admit that I spent much of my childhood wanting to be a Jedi.
My sister and I would duel for hours in the backyard with our plastic lightsabers, having to pause between whacks and parries to negotiate whose limbs were still attached or how far back we were supposed to move when the other pushed with the Force.
As a teenager, &lt;em&gt;The Force Unleashed&lt;/em&gt; on the Wii was magic: my remote was my lightsaber, my nunchuk was my connection to the Force, and the galaxy was filled with Stormtroopers to send flying.
(Too bad it 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.escapistmagazine.com/v2/explaining-star-wars-the-force-unleashed-controversial-place-in-the-expanded-universe/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;kind of sort of isn&amp;rsquo;t canon&lt;/a&gt;.)
Now, as an adult and a whole sequel trilogy and two seasons of &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; later — not to mention the nine seasons of &lt;em&gt;The Clone Wars&lt;/em&gt; that I&amp;rsquo;m still catching up on — I&amp;rsquo;m all in on Star Wars growing up with me, learning how to tell new and more mature stories.
&lt;em&gt;Jedi: Fallen Order&lt;/em&gt; is exactly that, putting the player at the center of a decent Jedi story with slick Jedi combat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;img data-src=&#34;https://jdaymude.github.io/review/videogame-jedi-fallen-order/scouttroopers_hude06c35df865cbabc11390a267dc31da_3295951_2000x2000_fit_lanczos_2.png&#34; class=&#34;lazyload&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;1920&#34; height=&#34;1080&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jedi: Fallen Order&lt;/em&gt; takes place during The Purge, which for the uninitiated is a period of Star Wars history just after the majority of Jedi are executed by their clone allies in &lt;em&gt;Revenge of the Sith&lt;/em&gt; (Order 66).
The fledgling Empire casts the few Jedi who survive as traitors to the Republic, hunting them down to either kill them or turn them to the Dark Side as Inquisitors (ex-Jedi who hunt Jedi).
You play as Cal Kestis, a padawan who experienced deep personal loss and trauma during Order 66 and has been concealing his powers to survive The Purge.
Other major characters include Cere Junda, an ex-Jedi Master who severed her connection with the Force after an especially traumatic event during The Purge, and a Nightsister whose people were killed in genocide during the Clone Wars.
This is a Star Wars story where nobody&amp;rsquo;s okay and the heroes are the ones who are brave enough to believe in one another as they heal.&lt;/p&gt;





  
  











&lt;figure &gt;


  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://jdaymude.github.io/review/videogame-jedi-fallen-order/ilumbattle_hu09f15c0bcdcda375de7ea645566f48cd_3799220_2000x2000_fit_lanczos_2.png&#34; &gt;


  &lt;img data-src=&#34;https://jdaymude.github.io/review/videogame-jedi-fallen-order/ilumbattle_hu09f15c0bcdcda375de7ea645566f48cd_3799220_2000x2000_fit_lanczos_2.png&#34; class=&#34;lazyload&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;1920&#34; height=&#34;1080&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gameplay absolutely does what it needs to do to make you feel like a Jedi, from customizing your lightsaber to dueling against powerful adversaries to bonding with a droid companion.
I think all of those things were non-negotiables for a modern Star Wars game, and as such, it suffices to say that &lt;em&gt;Jedi: Fallen Order&lt;/em&gt; does them well.
What&amp;rsquo;s really special about this game is how cool it makes you feel despite Cal not being the greatest of Jedi.
He&amp;rsquo;s hidden his abilities for years, presumably.
At best, he&amp;rsquo;s just rusty and has forgotten a lot of his training; at worst, his trauma and guilt pushes his connection with the Force towards fear and unpolished lack of control.
In the early stages of the game, Cal can&amp;rsquo;t even move stuff around with the Force; he can wall-run, however (Respawn just couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist sprinkling in a little &lt;em&gt;Titanfall&lt;/em&gt;, could they?).
His best ability, psychometry, makes him a better anthropologist than Stormtrooper-slayer: he can sense an object&amp;rsquo;s history by touching it, filling out the backstory of the different planets and societies he interacts with.&lt;/p&gt;





  
  











&lt;figure &gt;


  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://jdaymude.github.io/review/videogame-jedi-fallen-order/dathomir_hu1243943952a5fdf76277be63ba3703ec_2975053_2000x2000_fit_lanczos_2.png&#34; &gt;


  &lt;img data-src=&#34;https://jdaymude.github.io/review/videogame-jedi-fallen-order/dathomir_hu1243943952a5fdf76277be63ba3703ec_2975053_2000x2000_fit_lanczos_2.png&#34; class=&#34;lazyload&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;1920&#34; height=&#34;1080&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The five playable planets in this galaxy far, far away are largely linear, keeping you moving towards your next plot point.
There&amp;rsquo;s not a side quest to be seen, and the only exploration Cal can do is to veer off the main path for a slightly less obvious path where he might find a secret or unlockable cosmetic.
(As an aside, I love that Cal wears ponchos — as opposed to, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, Jedi robes? — but I can&amp;rsquo;t get over how over half of them are badly-fitting, hoodless, plastic raincoats.)
100%-ing &lt;em&gt;Jedi: Fallen Order&lt;/em&gt; is a fine and relatively quick experience (except for the very Star Wars and very bad 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://game-maps.com/SWJFO/Jedi-Fallen-Order-Maps.asp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;holomaps&lt;/a&gt;), revisiting planets when equipped with new Force abilities to get into previously inaccessible nooks and crannies.
This feels less like a chore and more like virtual space-tourism, giving players a second chance to appreciate the beautifully crafted set design and try out the very nicely implemented photo mode.&lt;/p&gt;





  
  











&lt;figure &gt;


  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://jdaymude.github.io/review/videogame-jedi-fallen-order/fortressinquisitoris_hud5dd9248f697357f9555c538c13da0e0_3009625_2000x2000_fit_lanczos_2.png&#34; &gt;

&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, &lt;em&gt;Jedi: Fallen Order&lt;/em&gt; does what it came to do: put players in the shoes of a Jedi powered by the best of what 2019 tech could offer.
The experience certainly feels more self-contained and linear than what we may have hoped, but it&amp;rsquo;s good for what it is.
With EA&amp;rsquo;s Star Wars exclusivity 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wired.com/story/lucasfilm-games-star-wars-ubisoft-indiana-jones-bethesda/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;now expired&lt;/a&gt;, maybe Ubisoft&amp;rsquo;s Massive Entertainment will give us the beautiful, open-world Star Wars playground of little-Josh&amp;rsquo;s dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bugs&#34;&gt;Bugs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know this isn&amp;rsquo;t a bug but it&amp;rsquo;s so bad that I&amp;rsquo;m calling it one: every sad excuse for a Wookiee in this game (except Tarfull) looks like a stick with clumpy fur.
To the developers at Respawn, Chewbacca would be disappointed in you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Outer Worlds</title>
      <link>https://jdaymude.github.io/review/videogame-the-outer-worlds/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2020 12:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid>https://jdaymude.github.io/review/videogame-the-outer-worlds/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Outer Worlds&lt;/em&gt; promised to let you, &amp;ldquo;the unknown variable,&amp;rdquo; truly role-play in the wild world of Halycon. Want to be the hero and save the world? Sure, who doesn&amp;rsquo;t? Want to steer your jaded friends towards self-awareness and hope? Just might work. Want to murder everyone on sight, including major companions and story-critical characters? Have a great time, you monster. Streamers have basically tried it all, and the game does indeed deliver. I particularly enjoyed embodying some kind of scientist/intellectual with an aversion for violence and a deep need to screw some corporate tools over.&lt;/p&gt;





  
  











&lt;figure &gt;


  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://jdaymude.github.io/review/videogame-the-outer-worlds/edgewaternight_hua95115548d781dc70255b1e6927bd015_2440629_2000x2000_fit_lanczos_2.png&#34; &gt;


  &lt;img data-src=&#34;https://jdaymude.github.io/review/videogame-the-outer-worlds/edgewaternight_hua95115548d781dc70255b1e6927bd015_2440629_2000x2000_fit_lanczos_2.png&#34; class=&#34;lazyload&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;1920&#34; height=&#34;1080&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What most impressed me was the world building packed into this tight, 40-ish hour experience. Every character looks different, has their own believable personality, and acts based on real fears and hopes. Most remember past encounters with you and have whole conversations scripted for the late-game, even when they&amp;rsquo;re just &amp;ldquo;extras&amp;rdquo; that have nothing to do with the ongoing story. Your companions are the best examples of the developers&amp;rsquo; care and attention to detail: one companion develops a love interest and wants to grab drinks with you to get your thoughts — this leads to a tipsy bar visit where you get to give dating advice. Other characters are working through past hurts and losses that shape who they are in the current narrative. It all feels very &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt;, and that aspect alone (against the stark contrast of the very inhumane slave-like colony townships) is enough to pull you into the first several hours of gameplay and give gravity to the difficult choices you have to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The characters made me savor conversations, walking up to every NPC just to make sure I wasn&amp;rsquo;t missing personal backstories or historical context. I found myself imagining those who would be unjustly punished for my decisions to stir up trouble, or who I could win over by showing some semblance of kindness. The world felt open and full of possibility, while harboring many situations with hidden consequences.&lt;/p&gt;





  
  











&lt;figure &gt;


  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://jdaymude.github.io/review/videogame-the-outer-worlds/lavaflows_hu69c586f845e63269f64449ba8b24ebf9_2669693_2000x2000_fit_lanczos_2.png&#34; &gt;


  &lt;img data-src=&#34;https://jdaymude.github.io/review/videogame-the-outer-worlds/lavaflows_hu69c586f845e63269f64449ba8b24ebf9_2669693_2000x2000_fit_lanczos_2.png&#34; class=&#34;lazyload&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;1920&#34; height=&#34;1080&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, some of this delightful, game-outside-the-game enchantment faded when I realized a very simple reality: what felt like a cliff of consequence was really just a short ledge, and every mistake I made could usually be solved by shooting my way through. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily the only solution (for example, I appreciated the go-and-kill quests that offered diplomacy as a non-violent alternative), but violence was often the path of least resistance. I slowly deteriorated from a hero who respected life — killing only when just or necessary — to a skilled mercenary with a vague conscience who also happened to enjoy conversation. The magic wasn&amp;rsquo;t there in the same way after that reality set in.&lt;/p&gt;





  
  











&lt;figure &gt;


  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://jdaymude.github.io/review/videogame-the-outer-worlds/scylla_hu224bb35c97e260bf23d205f44c29c329_2845510_2000x2000_fit_lanczos_2.png&#34; &gt;


  &lt;img data-src=&#34;https://jdaymude.github.io/review/videogame-the-outer-worlds/scylla_hu224bb35c97e260bf23d205f44c29c329_2845510_2000x2000_fit_lanczos_2.png&#34; class=&#34;lazyload&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;1920&#34; height=&#34;1080&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is what &lt;em&gt;The Outer Worlds&lt;/em&gt; had promised all along: that there would be many paths that one could fully explore, even if not all of are equally satisfying. It&amp;rsquo;s less that you live with your choices and more that your choices happen to the game, forcing it to bend and twist around you. And in that way, it really is a wonderful role-playing experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bugs&#34;&gt;Bugs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had a syncing issue with save files between different Xbox consoles, but this may have been a fluke.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was one view on Monarch where the environment didn&amp;rsquo;t render correctly, and whole stone structures seemed to disappear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was awarded one achievement (&amp;ldquo;Pirate Radio&amp;rdquo;) out of the blue, unsure what exactly I did to get it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Sputnik Eyes</title>
      <link>https://jdaymude.github.io/review/videogame-sputnik-eyes/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 13 Apr 2016 12:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid>https://jdaymude.github.io/review/videogame-sputnik-eyes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sputnik Eyes&lt;/em&gt; is a puzzle game adorned with a playful atmosphere in which you&amp;rsquo;re tasked with guiding exploratory colored robots to matching color positions in order to discover new planets. The aesthetic is greatly inspired by space exploration and the mathematical field of graph theory, which delivers enjoyable mechanics for mathy logic puzzles in minimalist artwork and easily understood controls. The UI is full of adorable artwork, reminiscent of cartoon depictions of outer space that might decorate a child&amp;rsquo;s bedroom. The soundtrack is similarly dreamy, leveraging a handful of light, instrumental electronic songs on rotation to keep any one from becoming overplayed.&lt;/p&gt;





  
  











&lt;figure &gt;


  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://jdaymude.github.io/review/videogame-sputnik-eyes/level_hu4b4ff64bd98f5c51248ec04c7cd85531_222619_2000x2000_fit_lanczos_2.png&#34; &gt;


  &lt;img data-src=&#34;https://jdaymude.github.io/review/videogame-sputnik-eyes/level_hu4b4ff64bd98f5c51248ec04c7cd85531_222619_2000x2000_fit_lanczos_2.png&#34; class=&#34;lazyload&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;1136&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the levels vary in the layout of finishing positions and the number of robots, gameplay does have the potential to get somewhat repetitive, which I feel the game designer — Shelly Alon, who developed this game singlehandedly — was likely aware of. Completed levels form constellations (out of planets, not stars), and the game ends after just 65 planets — setting itself apart from content-vomiters like &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt; — and doesn&amp;rsquo;t force players to replay levels extensively to achieve some unlikely high score. Instead, there are challenges to complete levels under a (generous) time limit, and to do so in the minimum possible number of robot moves, providing a shallow level of replayability for those who want it.&lt;/p&gt;





  
  











&lt;figure &gt;


  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;https://jdaymude.github.io/review/videogame-sputnik-eyes/constellation_huec79b848a40fbc6e180e238cf7544ebf_147126_2000x2000_fit_lanczos_2.png&#34; &gt;


  &lt;img data-src=&#34;https://jdaymude.github.io/review/videogame-sputnik-eyes/constellation_huec79b848a40fbc6e180e238cf7544ebf_147126_2000x2000_fit_lanczos_2.png&#34; class=&#34;lazyload&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;640&#34; height=&#34;1136&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, &lt;em&gt;Sputnik Eyes&lt;/em&gt; is a satisfying puzzle game resulting from heartfelt, thoughtful work that turns a hopeful eye to what lies beyond our atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
